    <h2 class="Red">Basketball</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I admire basketball and consider it my best friend in tough and difficult moments. I started playing basketball when i was 8 and i've been in love with it ever since. The reason why i'm passionate about basketall is because it substantialy increased my hieght and it helped me find more enjoyment in other sports as well by helping me increase my ability to jump higher.</p>

    <h2 class="Purple">Buggati</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The reason why I adore such a rare supercar like Buggati is because its unbelievably fast and its exterior design is nothing like anthing i've seen before. Intially i wasn't a big supercar guy, but when i had an opportunity to view an Buggati for the first time upclose at a very young age, I've started admiring it ever since. My dream is to hopefully own one of these sometime in the future, despite the fact how expenisive they're listed at.

      <hr />
    </p>
       Intially, when i was still living in India, i wasn't a fanbooy of gaming. But when i immigrated to Canada, i disco0vered gaming as a big part of my life due to my boredom at home when my parents were at work. Gaming with my friends helped me alleviate my boredom as well as the stress about homework. Even though i lost interest in gaming ever since i entered high school, but i still consider it one of my most favourite activities that made my childhood more memorable and entertaining.</p>

   <h2 class="Green">ISHOWSPEED</h2>
      <hr />
    </p>
      Ishowspeed is a youtube/entertainer with over 20 million susbscribers. He was born and raised in Ohio and i find Speed very enthusiastic, humorous, and kind hearted. He respects and reverences his fans to the point that he even went to jail for them, because Speed's fans demanded Speed to prank call the police department. Without his fans, he wouldn't have gained the wealth and popularity he owns today. But overall he's a very humorous young man who loves entertaining and helping his fans cure their despression and stress.

    all the police. Speed does anything his fans demand because they are the reason why he encountered with his idol(Cristiano Ronaldo). Without his fans,
